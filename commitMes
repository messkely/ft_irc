added errno EAGAIN check in both Client::recvMessages and Client::sendReplies when send/recv return with failure
resp and procCmds were replaced by reply and procMessages respectively
removed the recursive search for a valid command in the received message and limited it to a single one (msgUtils.cpp -> msgHasCommand)
went over all comments for potential unfinished tasks
added Bot::removeClient which takes the nickname of the target ClientMetadata object and removes it from Bot::ClientData
added !quit option to bot which calls Bot::removeClient
prevented client from changing nickname when in game
added a call to Bot::removeClient after game termination in both (win) and (out of guesses) cases
added behavior for notifying bot when in game client is leaving the server
changed Server::leaveAllChannels to clearAllHistory (leaves channels/invite lists and notfies bot when in game)
